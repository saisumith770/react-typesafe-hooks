# React Typesafe Hooks
This library is focused at typesafe utility hooks. We may not have a vast majority of hooks as compared to libraries like react-use but all of our hooks are built with typesafety in mind and are aimed majorly for typescript developers.<br>
The package can be installed via npm by executing:<br>

    npm i react-typesafe-hooks

## Builds
I see that the `.map` files are not useful in production builds so if you wanted to compress the folder, we would suggest adding the following commands to your production script in npm.<br>
**windows**

    npm explore react-typesafe-hooks -- npm run windows-build

**mac**

    npm explore react-typesafe-hooks -- npm run mac-build

**linux**

    npm explore react-typesafe-hooks -- npm run linux-build
