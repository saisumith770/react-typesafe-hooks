# React Typesafe Hooks
This library is focused at typesafe utility hooks. We may not have a vast majority of hooks as compared to libraries like react-use but all of our hooks are built with typesafety in mind and are aimed majorly for typescript developers.<br>
The package can be installed via npm by executing:<br>

    npm i react-typesafe-hooks
